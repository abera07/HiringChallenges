##Repository to strategically prepare for placements.

This repository was created primarily to capture the _trend_ of the challenges and the evolution coding questions given by various companies, during on-campus placements in **Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, 2022.** 

When I first started this journey, I had no vision no guidance and this is what I could gather in an **ad-hoc** style of preparations. It has no certain sequencing of the folder organization, feel free to just browse through.

_I am open to any questions from this repo!_
